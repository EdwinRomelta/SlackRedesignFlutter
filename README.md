# Slack Redesign Challange - Flutter (iOS & Android)

# Description
Exploring the power of UI in flutter, I decided to create something cool.
I saw the concept of flutter while browsing uplaps (https://www.uplabs.com/posts/slack-redesing-challenge)
My flutter redesign is not exactly same as the uplabs version but quite similar, I used the default flutter icons and colors to keep it simple.
Here I reveal the power of flutter.

Beautify your applications with flutter :)
Very simple to implement and looks awesome. You can find more details in sample app.
